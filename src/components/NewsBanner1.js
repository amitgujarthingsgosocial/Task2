    We began our COVID relief work
     in April 2020 and supported our 
     NGO partners trying to ease the
      suffering of families caught in
       the eye of the pandemic storm â€“
        with donations from you. We have
         also received support from corporates, HNIs and philanthropic foundations and many donations through Facebook. 
    Here is the impact report of ICRF-1.</p>
